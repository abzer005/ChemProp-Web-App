# Chemical Proportionality: ChemProp2
This Notebook creates Chemical Proportionality score between two similar Feature IDs. The information regarding the similarity of features is obtained from Network edge file (which is a feature-based MN GNPS output)

Chemprop2 scores the correlation between two similar features and tells if they are negatively or positively correlated as well as the directionality of the negative correlation. By directionality, the score tells if feature A is converted to feature B or vice-versa with respect to 'time or space'.

## Kindly run the ChemProp2 script with the latest date
