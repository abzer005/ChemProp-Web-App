st.write("""
         ChemProp2 is a tool developed to address a key challenge in non-targeted metabolomics using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC‚ÄìMS/MS), 
         particularly in the study of biotransformation studies like drug metabolism as well as xenobiotic and natural product biotransformation in the environment. 
        
         Analyzing and annotating the vast data from metabolomic studies still remains a challenge. Various in silico methods and spectral similarity metrics have been developed to tackle this issue. 
         Tools like GNPS (now GNPS2) use Feature-based Molecular Networking (FBMN) to create molecular networks by connecting metabolites with similar MS/MS spectral profiles. 
         ChemProp2 builds on this, identifying potential biotransformations within these networks. It detects anti-correlating metabolites and putatibve reaction pairs, scoring their correlation over time or space. 
         This helps in prioritizing and visualizing biochemical alterations within the network.
        
         ChemProp2 is particularly useful when dealing with more than two sequential data points. Go to the module ChemProp1 for studies with only two data points. [To read more about this](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c01520)""")

# Input Files
st.subheader('Input File Requirements')
st.write(""" 
         The accepted formats for the manually uploading the input files are **CSV**, **TXT**, or **XLSX**. The necessary files include:
         1. **Feature Quantification Table**
         2. **Metadata** 
         3. **Edge File** from FBMN - This is essential for analyzing connections between node pairs (metabolites).
         4. **Annotation Files** (if available) from FBMN - These files provide additional context and annotation for the features in your dataset.
         
         Instead of manually uploading these files, you can also provide your FBMN Job ID from GNPS2. 
         This will allow ChemProp2 to directly retrieve and process the necessary data. To get an idea of how these tables should be structured, you can use the test data available on the ‚ÄòLoad Input Data‚Äô page.
         **Note:** FBMN jobs from GNPS1 are not supported.

### Data Preparation Essentials
To ensure smooth processing, follow these guidelines:

- Input files must include the `.mzML` extension in the feature quantification table and metadata table.
- **Metadata Table**:
  - Must include a column **filename**.
  - Can include attribute columns such as **replicates**, **sample type** (e.g., control, treatment), etc.
  - **Time**: A specific column for time is mandatory.

Upon processing your data, ChemProp2 generates an output in the form of a CSV file. 
This file is an enhanced version of the node-pair information, now including ChemProp2 scores for each pair. 
The scores range from -1 to +1, providing a comprehensive score for every edge (or node pair) within the molecular network.
         
Key aspects of the output CSV include:
- **Score Range**: Each node pair gets a score between -1 and +1.
- **Score Interpretation**: 
  - The magnitude of the score indicates the strength of the potential transformation. 
  - The sign of the score (positive or negative) reveals the directionality of the transformation. 
  - For example, in a node pair A & B, the sign of the score will indicate whether the transformation is from A to B or vice versa.

st.write("""
### Integration with Cytoscape
- You can download the results as a **zip file** containing the required **GraphML** and **style files** for Cytoscape visualization.
- To use the output in Cytoscape:
  1. Open the **GraphML** file in Cytoscape.
  2. Import the **style file**:
     - Navigate to **File > Import > Styles from File**.
     - Select and upload the `.xml` style file.
  3. Apply the imported style:
     - Go to the **Styles** panel in Cytoscape.  
     - By default, the style will be set to **default**.  
     - Use the drop-down menu to select the uploaded style (it may appear as **default_0** or another variation).  
     - The visualization will update based on the selected style.

st.write("""
### Additional Visualizations and Features
- **Global Transformation Patterns**: Visualize overall transformation trends in your data with a score plot showing ChemProp scores against various mass differences.
- **Filtering Options**: Use filters to refine scores by range, mass, annotation name, or cluster ID, displaying only relevant edges in a list. Selecting an edge shows:
  - The intensity trends for node pairs belonging to that edge.
  - The corresponding node pair within the molecular network as a subnetwork. (Note: Full network visualization is minimized for simplified rendering, showing only the relevant cluster and its ChemProp2 scores with directional indicators.)
  - **Export Visualizations**: Save these visualizations as PNG files for easy sharing and documentation.
